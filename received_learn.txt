How BitTorrent works (big picture only) ✅
Basic P2P architectures ✅

--- Networking fundamentals
TCP vs UDP ✅
Ports, sockets ✅
NAT, firewalls ✅
Client–server vs peer-to-peer ✅
Latency, bandwidth, packet loss ✅

--- Concurrency & parallelism
Threads vs goroutines
Race conditions
Deadlocks
Backpressure
Async I/O
Fan-out / fan-in patterns

--- File systems & storage
File chunking
Random access reads/writes
Hashing large files
Disk I/O vs memory
File integrity

--- Distributed systems concepts
Nodes & peers
Discovery
Gossip
Fault tolerance
Partial failure
Eventual consistency
CAP theorem

--- Hashing & data integrity
Cryptographic hashes (SHA-1, SHA-256)
Merkle trees (VERY important later)
Chunk verification
Content-addressed storage

--- Serialization & wire protocols
Binary vs text protocols
Message framing
Endianness
Versioning
-Formats to understand
JSON (easy)
Protobuf (important)
Bencoding (BitTorrent-specific)

--- Introducing Blockchain (Later, not first)
Concepts
Public/private keys
Signatures
Merkle trees (again!)
Consensus (high level)
Smart contracts
Gas & fees

--- Go-friendly stacks
Ethereum (geth, go-ethereum)
Cosmos SDK
Tendermint
libp2p (HUGE for this project)

Advanced Topics (Optional but Powerful)
libp2p
IPFS (study it, don’t clone it blindly)
Kademlia DHT
QUIC
Rate control algorithms
Observability (metrics, tracing)
